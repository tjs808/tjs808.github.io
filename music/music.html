            <p>Music has always been super important to me. My Spotify account usually ends the year with a 'minutes listened' stat between 100,000 and 125,000. That's about 1,666 hours, or about<i>70 days.</i></p>
            <p>You can read more about specific aspects of my involvement with music on other pages. One page goes over my instrument, the violin. The other is a list of my top three favorite albums of all time. I'm not saying those three albums are objectively the best, just that they're my favorites.</p>
