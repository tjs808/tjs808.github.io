            <h2>Before College</h2>
            <p> I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin. While I attended high school in New Richmond, I developed my hobbies, including music, photography, and running. I also served as president of a few clubs, and worked part time at Target.</p>

            <h2>Now</h2>
            <p>Today, I'm a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm pursuing a double major in economics and sociology. I'm involved in a few clubs here as well, and I still work at Target.</p>

            <h2>Postgrad Plans</h2>
            <p>I'm hoping to go to law school. I haven't decided where yet, but I'm looking at a few different options: I'll know more once I take the LSAT. I want to go into litigation, but the contracts side of things would be interesting, too.</p>
